```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(minionator)
library(tidyverse)

l <- discrete_matrix(3, 3, 0:2)

row_latin <- tribble(
  ~constraint,             ~variables,
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(row == 0),
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(row == 1),
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(row == 2)
)

column_latin <- tribble(
  ~constraint,             ~variables,
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(col == 0),
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(col == 1),
    "alldiff", l %>% filter(col == 2)
)

list(
          variables = l,
             search = "PRINT ALL",
  unary_constraints = bind_rows(row_latin, column_latin)
) %>%
  minion_output()
```
